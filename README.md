LeetCode Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode algorithm problems. All solutions are implemented in Python.

Why LeetCode?                     
LeetCode is a platform that provides coding challenges for software engineers to improve their coding skills, prepare for job interviews, and learn new algorithms and data structures.

The platform contains a vast collection of problems, each with a varying level of difficulty, ranging from easy to hard. Solving these problems will help you understand different algorithms and data structures and improve your problem-solving skills.

What's included?                       
This repository contains Python solutions to problems in LeetCode's algorithm section. Each solution contains the problem statement, an explanation of the approach taken, and the Python code.

How to use?                      
To use this repository, simply clone or download it to your local machine.                      
git clone https://github.com/your_username/LeetCode-algorithms.git

Each solution is in a separate folder named after the problem's ID and contains a Python file with the solution code and a markdown file with the problem statement and the approach explanation.
